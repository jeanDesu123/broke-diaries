# broke-diaries
A repository of my website

Hi! I want to become a full - stack web developer. Currently, I am learning my way through the process of creating websites and web applications. Broke Diaries is a website that I will create via Github that will allow me to showcase my talents in coding at the same time save my blog entry posts in the near future.

This will become my domain here in the internet and I will do my best to make this work.
