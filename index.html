            <h1>Hi There! Welcome to My Portfolio!</h1>
              <p>My name is <span class = "myName">Jean M. Altarejos</span>. I am the one who created this website.
              I am an aspiring web developer and I am working my way towards achieving that goal. To start, I will create
              my self-imposed projects here. I am also planning to create a blog post about my journey of becoming a web developer.
              I live in the Philippines. I am still finishing my undergraduate degree in Information Technology. I almost given up
              programming because I thought I will never learn how to code since I have no idea what to study first given the fact that I
              had to give work as a Call Center agent for 7 years. Programming never left me in fact during the entire 7 years,
              my mind kept reminding me to learn how to code again. Since I have a lot of excuses I was taken further and further away from my dream job
              Then it came upon me that I am sick and tired of being an agent anymore. I wanna learn something new. That is where I faced my fears and learn
              programming on my own. I became consistent and men I didn't know how humbling this feeling is. Like, I regret all those years making up excuses when in fact
              this is really what I want.</p>

              <h3>For those of you who thought that it is going to be the end of the line. Trust me, it is just the beginning. Hang on tight and pursue your dreams. </h3>
